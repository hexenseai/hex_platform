# Hexense AI Platform â€“ Concept Overview

Hexense is a GPT-powered, modular business automation platform. It enables users to create and manage enterprise workflows using custom GPT assistants. The system supports real-time chat interactions, task execution, dynamic widget rendering, and role-based memory.

## Core Features

- **GPT-based Modular Architecture**: Users can interact with specialized GPT packages assigned to roles (e.g., sales assistant, technical support, analyst).
- **Dynamic Chat Interface**: Messages include structured metadata (active GPT, user actions, linked widgets) and are persisted per user/project.
- **Widget Integration**: GPTs can generate and render HTML/JS/CSS widgets dynamically inside the chat or in dashboards.
- **Memory System**: Embedding-based memory stores user context, enabling long-term learning and personalized assistant behavior.
- **Secure API Routing**: All GPT packages run through a central dispatcher that supports OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, and local LLMs.

## Use Cases

- Business process automation and AI task agents
- Knowledge base querying with contextual memory
- Enterprise dashboards powered by GPT-generated components
- Integration with internal services via prompt orchestration

## Technical Stack

- Backend: Django + PostgreSQL
- Frontend: TailwindCSS, DevExtreme, jQuery (React planned)
- AI Engine: OpenAI API, vector embeddings, prompt-routing
- Additional: Godot-based experimental 3D interface for advanced workflow visualizations

## Future Goals

- Team collaboration inside AI chats
- Semantic search over user memory
- Ontology-driven no-code prompt composition
- Visual agent orchestration with dynamic node linking
